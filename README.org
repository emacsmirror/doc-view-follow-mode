#+title: doc-follow.el: Synchronize windows showing the same document
#+author: Paul Nelson

* Overview

doc-follow.el provides a minor mode, =doc-follow-mode=, that automatically synchronizes page navigation between multiple windows displaying the same PS/PDF/DVI/DjVu document.  In particular, this allows for a convenient "book view," with two windows showing consecutive pages side-by-side.

* Installation

You can install =doc-follow.el= by downloading the source file and running:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/doc-follow.el RET
#+end_src

* Usage

After installation, you can activate the mode:

- Globally: =M-x global-doc-follow-mode=
- Locally: =M-x doc-follow-mode=

To enable synchronization by default, add to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-doc-follow-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Example workflow:

1. Open a supported document in =doc-view-mode= or =pdf-view-mode=.  
   (=doc-view-mode= is built-in; =pdf-view-mode= requires [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]].)
2. Split the frame vertically (with default bindings, via =C-x 3=).
3. Activate =doc-follow-mode= if not already enabled.
4. Navigate pages in either window with standard commands (e.g., =n=, =p=).

Both windows will automatically stay synchronized.

* Extensibility

One could add support for additional document viewing modes (if any) via the =doc-follow-modes= variable.
